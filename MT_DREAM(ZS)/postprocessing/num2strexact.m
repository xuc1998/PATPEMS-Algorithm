%  *
%  *  Building:
%  *
%  *  num2strexact requires that a mex routine be built (one time only). This
%  *  process is typically self-building the first time you call the function
%  *  as long as you have the files num2strexact.m and num2strexact.c in the same
%  *  directory somewhere on the MATLAB path. If you need to manually build
%  *  the mex function, here are the commands:
%  *
%  *  >> mex -setup
%  *    (then follow instructions to select a C / C++ compiler of your choice)
%  *  >> mex num2strexact.c
%  *
%  * num2strexact is a mex function that converts a double or single input to
%  * the exact decimal string. The conversion is done with hundreds of digits
%  * of precision to maintain the exact conversion. The conversion uses the
%  * exact decimal value of each bit of the IEEE double precision floating
%  * point format along with the exact application of 2^exponent. Inf and NaN
%  * bit patterns are recognized, and denormalized numbers are handled also.
%  *
%  * Don't confuse the exact conversion with significance! Double numbers will
%  * only be significant to about 15 decimal digits, and single numbers will
%  * only be significant to about 7 decimal digits. For example,
%  *
%  * >> format hex
%  * >> 1.2
%  * ans =
%  *     3ff3333333333333
%  * >> num2strexact(1.2)
%  * ans =
%  *     1.1999999999999999555910790149937383830547332763671875
%  *
%  * >> 1.2 + eps(1.2)
%  * ans =
%  *     3ff3333333333334   <-- one bit different from 1.2
%  * num2strexact(1.2 + eps(1.2))
%  * ans =
%  *     1.20000000000000017763568394002504646778106689453125
%  *
%  * >> num2strexact(eps(1.2))
%  * ans =
%  *     2.220446049250313080847263336181640625e-16
%  *
%  * You can see that 1.2 is not represented exactly in IEEE double format.
%  * The difference shows up in the 18th digit for this example. Then note
%  * that the very next number in the IEEE double format model is about 2e-16
%  * bigger. The exact conversions are shown for each number, but they are
%  * not significant beyond the 16th digit shown. There are no numbers in
%  * between these two numbers that can be represented in IEEE double format.
%  *
%  * Syntax:
%  *
%  *   Y = num2strexact(X [,'fixed' or 'float'])
%  *   [Y1 Y2] = num2strexact(X1,X2 [,'fixed' or 'float'])
%  *   [Y1 Y2 Y3] = num2strexact(X1,X2,X3 [,'fixed' or 'float'])
%  *       :           :
%  *      etc         etc
%  *
%  * X = double or single or half
%  *
%  * NOTE: The half type can be input in one of two ways:
%  *       1) A uint16 class variable containing the half bit patterns
%  *       2) A half class variable. num2strexact must have access to the
%  *          underlying bit patterns, so if you input a half class variable,
%  *          then this will first be converted to the equivalent integer bit
%  *          patterns with the storedInteger function (a temporary deep copy).
%  *
%  * The number of inputs must match the number of outputs, except in the
%  * special case of 1 input and 0 outputs where the result will simply be
%  * put into ans. If the input is a scalar, the output will be a char string.
%  * If the input is any other size array, the result will be a cell array of
%  * the same dimensions as the input, with each cell containing the char
%  * string conversion of the corresponding element.
%  *
%  * The optional 'fixed' argument forces the result to be fixed point.
%  *
%  * The optional 'float' argument forces the result to be floating point. All
%  * numbers will be printed with exponents, even if the exponent is 0.
%  *
%  * The default will be fixed or floating point depending on the size of the
%  * decimal exponent.  Numbers with -1 <= (decimal exponent) <= 2 will be
%  * displayed as fixed point, else the number will be displayed as floating
%  * point.
%  *
%  * All NaN bit patterns, regardless of the sign bit and payload, will be
%  * returned simply as the string 'NaN'.
%  *
%  * Infinity bit patterns will be returned as 'Inf' or '-Inf' as appropriate.
%  *
%  * Revision History:
%  *   2009-Aug-09 , Initial Release
%  *   2020-Jun-10 , Added optional 'fixed' or 'float' input
%  *                 Added half support (input as half or uint16 type)
