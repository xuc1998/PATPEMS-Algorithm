function [R,E] = gchol(A)
% Computes the Gill-Murray generalized Cholesky decomposition of 
% M = A + E = dot(L,L') where
% M is safely symmetric positive definite (SPD) and well conditioned
% E is small (zero if A is already SPD and not much larger than the most
% negative eigenvalues of A)
% In some implementations, e is the diagonal of the correction matrix,
% thus, E = diag(e);
